# Data
In our experiments, we used WikiSQL, ESQL as benchmarks, and WikiTableQuestions as semi-supervised data. All of which can be downloaded by [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nnN2Yph_FGxisPo4_SwkWQ4YO8E69-AX?usp=sharing). After obtaining the data, make a new file named "data" in root directory, and put the data into that file.
